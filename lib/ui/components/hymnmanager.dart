    "Nearer, my God, to thee,Nearer to thee! E'en though it be a cross That raiseth me.Still all my song shall beNearer, my God, to thee,Nearer, my God, to thee,Nearer to thee!",
    "Though like the wanderer, The sun gone down, Darkness be over me, My rest a stone,Yet in my dreams I'd be Nearer, my God, to thee, Nearer, my God, to thee, Nearer to thee!",
    "There let the way appear, Steps unto heaven; All that thou sendest me, In mercy given; Angels to beckon me Nearer, my God, to thee, Nearer, my God, to thee, Nearer to thee!",
    "Then with my waking thoughts Bright with thy praise, Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise; So by my woes to be Nearer, my God, to thee, Nearer, my God, to thee, Nearer to thee!",
    "Or if, on joyful wing Cleaving the sky, Sun, moon, and stars forgot, Upward I fly, Still all my song shall be Nearer, my God, to thee, Nearer, my God, to thee, Nearer to thee!"
